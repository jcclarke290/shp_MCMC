Monte Carlo Markov Chain integration of Path integrals for Harmonic and Anharmonic Potentials including analysis file

Developed during final year of Computational Physics BSc, this project will generate a Markov Chain of paths for a particle in a given 
potential by using a Monte Carlo - Metropolis process alongside the Path Integral appraoch to Quantum Mechanics.

The Analysis file is included to allow determination of observables' values and results of the treatment of the fixed two point correlation function may be used to attempt to deduce the first level energy difference.

PDF of the project report is also included.

Project was finalised during the lockdown due to COVID-19 in the UK, as a result some of this work is patchy at best. 

This project was proposed and supervised by Professor A D Kennedy and Dr R Horsley at the University of Edinburgh where the project was completed with many thanks to their knowledge and insight.
